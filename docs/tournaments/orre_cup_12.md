# Orre Cup 12

![]({% link assets/images/oc12-banner.png %})

On April 27th, 2024, our community hosted the 12th Orre Cup. A total of 23 players[^1] competed in a 5-round Swiss tournament followed by an 8-player single elimination playoffs.

The tournament saw a relative absence of Gyarados and Swampert, both of which had high usage in past tournaments. Most players used top-tier threats in conjunction with their own personal choices. Once again Latias usage outnumbered Latios usage, owing to the former’s versatility and bulk in an open teamsheet, team-locked tournament.

ShoRii, an inactive member of the community, went undefeated in Swiss with a surprising team[^2] built around Shedinja and Explosion. Nnico Iosi showcased an innovative Blitzkrieg team[^3] that used no top-tier Pokémon at all. Both Michael Don and namboyVGC placed in the Top 8 using versions of Fundamentals, further proving the team’s effectiveness. Most notably, 3 of the tournament’s 5 Marowak were seen in the tournament’s top 4 teams, solidifying its status as a high-tier threat.

Mosquito defeated For 4LOM to win the tournament using a bulky offensive team supported by dual screens Latias[^4]. This marked his 5th Orre Cup win.

Congratulations to the top 8 for their success, and thank you to all competitors for their participation.
