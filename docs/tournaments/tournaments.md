# Tournaments

*Next tournament: Orre Cup 13 (TBA)*

---

The Orre Colosseum community hosts regular tournaments to determine the best teams and players in Generation III 4v4 Doubles. Our two tournament series, Orre Cup and Mt. Battle, have several format differences that set them apart. In addition, we occasionally host special events to showcase upcoming players and strategies.

## Orre Cup

Orre Cup is our live tournament series, with each tournament taking place within one day. What started as a casual competition has grown to the current structure seen today: a best-of-3 Swiss tournament leading into a best-of-5 single-elimination top cut, with teams locked and open teamsheets available. Even-numbered Orre Cups are played under the Standard format; odd-numbered Orre cups are played using other formats.
