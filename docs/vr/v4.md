## Definitions

S: These Pokémon can fit onto any team and will come out in nearly every game. If your goal is to win, you certainly use at least one of these Pokémon.

---

A: These Pokémon have rare qualities that can vastly improve a team, generally good stats, and advantageous matchups against some top tier threats.

---

B: These Pokémon are generally reliable and can be used on multiple types of teams. However they may be a bit predictable, have some major shortcomings, or be slightly outclassed.

---

C: These Pokémon have a small practical niche. It is possible to build reliable & threatening teams around these Pokémon, but they can be hard to use consistently due to their shortcomings.

---

D: These Pokémon have a practical niche, but it is extremely small. They are only considered in extremely specific circumstances, however in these cases the choice can be justified.

It’s recommended that new players do not attempt to use D tiers. They have specific niches (Dugtrio – fast trapper; Claydol – bulky Skill Swapper; Slaking – setup sweeper) that are difficult to properly use.
