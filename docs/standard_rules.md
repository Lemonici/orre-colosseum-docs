# Standard Rules
## Orre Colosseum (“Standard”) Format

This format is based on Pokémon XD’s Orre Colosseum.

- Team Preview: enabled

    - Celebi
    - Kyogre
    - Groudo
    - Rayquaza
    - Jirachi
    - Deoxys
- Permitted: the other 376 Pokémon

### Tiebreak Mechanics

- If a Pokémon knocks out all remaining Pokémon using Explosion or Self-Destruct, the user loses.
- IN-GAME: If a team’s final Pokémon uses Perish Song or Destiny Bond, the move fails.
- SHOWDOWN: If a Pokémon knocks out all remaining Pokémon using Perish Song or Destiny Bond, the user loses.
- If a Pokémon knocks out the last opposing Pokémon and then faints from recoil (e.g. Double-Edge), the user wins the game.
- If a Pokémon knocks out the last opposing Pokémon and then faints from retaliation damage (e.g. Rough Skin), [the result requires testing in-game].
- If all remaining Pokémon faint on the same turn due to residual damage (e.g. Sand, Poison), the game is a draw.
- If the game timer runs out, the player with the highest number of remaining Pokémon wins the game. If these numbers are the same, then the player with the highest remaining team HP percent (total HP remaining/total max HP of 4 party members) wins the game. If these numbers are the same, the game is a draw.
